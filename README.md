This is my repo for the xqemu project. A xbox-emulator based on qemu!
You can find more information at http://xqemu.com

If you want to try xqemu you should stick to the [offical version by espes](https://github.com/espes/xqemu).

This repo is currently used for Pull-Requests only.
The [Wiki](https://github.com/JayFoxRox/xqemu/wiki) might have some information to get you started.
This repo has feature-branches.
If you need a combination of features you should merge that locally or wait until it's merged with the offical version.

Please star this repo to show your love.

You can also help by reviewing [my Pull-Requests](https://github.com/espes/xqemu/pulls/JayFoxRox) or fixing my bugs.
I'll usually idle in the xqemu IRC channel ([#xqemu on freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#xqemu)) - feel free to contact me directly.
Please note that xqemu is a project for coders only at the moment. Don't bother contacting me if you don't know how to configure / make.
